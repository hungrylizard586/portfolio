            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Welcome to our iterative design journey! We decided to learn through prototyping a Desktop web interface for <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/azuki">Azuki</a>—a manga subscription service startup. The users of this website are manga readers and fans and they would be impacted by this product because it allows them to have access to many mangas under 1 cheap subscription and under 1 platform.</p>
            <h4>Why did I choose to do this project?</h4>
            <p>I am a manga enjoyer and have seen my fair share of not-so greatly designed manga apps and websites. When I learned about Azuki, it sounded so cool and convenient. Simple as that!</p>
        </div>

            <h1></h1>
            <h1>Initial Sketches</h1>
            <p>We began by brainstorming multiple possible interface designs for our site. Below are our initial rough sketches which represent a variety of layouts that we then workshopped and discussed to decide on a final design.
            </p>

            <h1>Wireframes</h1>
            <p>After completing our initial sketches, we worked as a team to combine and build our ideas into a wireframe design for our site. We slowly moved closer to a final layout. </p>

            <h1>Interactive HiFi Mockup</h1>
            <p> Next, we proceeded to translate our wireframes into a HiFi, interactive mockup using Figma. Here, we made big design choices using color, content, and hierarchy to build a usable mockup. 
            </p>
            <img src="azukihifi.png" width="400" height="400">
            <h5>Design Choices</h5>
            <p>
                One of the most important design choices we made was making our side legible. 
We chose a legible font, and created consistency by keeping every header in lowercase. We created visual hierarchy by using various colors on the page. Orange consistently was used as the color for the header, any intermediary between header and content was blue (the welcome sign) and text is always black for the purposes of color contrast. We also wanted a design that was as simple as possible, so users can clearly and easily navigate between pages. Everything is labeled in a simple and clear manner. We also wanted interactive elements to be clear, so we tried our best to make all interactive buttons intuitive (such as the down arrow for my library dropdown).

            </p>
            <h5>Critique</h5>
            <p> Following the methodology of a traditional iterative design process, we participated in a critique session where we received feedback on our mockup. Listed below are the points of feedback we received and linked <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/EtcflLQTgohIrQWn5ooW6b/Anonymous-Azuki-Hi-Fi?node-id=5%3A1793&starting-point-node-id=5%3A1793&scaling=scale-down">here</a> is our HiFi mockup, which incorporates the critiques we received. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Social media icons do not blend in with the design of the rest of our site (in terms of colors)
                </li>
                <li>My library dropdown should open with click every page that includes my library in the header.</li>
                <li>Titles of categories should be more noticeable (more spacing, different text styling for visual hierarchy)</li>
                <li>There should be a way to return back to title page after opening a book page.</li>
                <li>There should be an indication of how search results were sorted.</li>
                <li>Have phone number and email links</li>
                <li>Seach and home page look too similar. </li>
                <li>There should be a chapter guide in case a user does not want to start at the beginning.</li>
                <li>Continuity of capitalization is important.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1></h1>
            <h1>User Testing</h1>
            <p>We used a remote usability test to collect feedback from three users on our mockup. We provided test instructions and post-test questions so that the users could provide us with useful feedback:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Log into the site</li>
                <li>Scroll through recommended </li>  
                <li>Take as much time as you need to explore this website. Move on to the next task when you're ready.</li>
                <li>In your own words, what do you think you can do on this page? Be specific.</li>
                <li>Like a book</li>
                <li>Unlike a book</li>
                <li>Get to a library, any of 'my favorites' 'my recents' or 'my lists'</li>
                <li>Get to profile page and read the FAQ</li>
                <li>In your own words, describe how you might benefit from using Azuki.</li>
                <li>How unlikely or likely are you to use Azuki in the future? Explain your answer</li> 
            </ol>

            <h5>Overall Analysis</h5>
            <p> We expected that all of the tasks were going to be successfully completed, as the tasks we wrote represented the flow and functionality we attempted to build out in our prototype. Most of our tasks were successfully completed by all three testers and most of the difficulty and confusion came from the fact that our prototype is not 100% interactable and functional. All of these results matched our expectations and it was useful to see those expectations met by users who were outside of our team.
                <strong>Potential changes we would make given this feedback: </strong>Given this feedback, we would create much clearer navigation between pages (especially if we were to build out our HiFi into a real site), specifically with more clear “back” functionality and clearer methods for learnability. Maybe a pop-up to explain the page-flip functionality upon first use would be useful.

            <h4>This iterative design experience was one of invaluable learning for our team.
